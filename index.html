<p>Why are plants poisonous?</p>
<br>
<h1 align="Left"><p style = "font-size: 18px;">Plants have developed poisons because they cannot move to avoid predators. Plants have developed a variety of weapons (such as spines, hairs) and a lethal chemical arsenal.So Basically plants have developed poisons to somehow defend themselves against living things that consume them</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px;">Description</p>
<p style="font-size: 17px;">Opium has been extracted from the poppy seed in the same way since ancient times: by making an incision and letting the sap turn yellow before separating it and letting it dry. The opium is then ground into a powder, sold in chunks or treated. to obtain drugs such as morphine, codeine and heroin, which constitute the opiate family. </p>

<p style="font-size: 17px;">Opiates are effective analgesics, as well as highly addictive; they are one of the most widespread narcotics and the ones that have been most abused in history. Sumerians called the poppy "The Plant of Joy" around 3400 BC</p>
<p style="font-size: 17px;">Sydenham's laudanum contained 1 pound of Malaga wine, 2 ounces of opium, 1 ounce of saffron, and 1 drachm of cinnamon and cloves. It was commonly used to relieve any type of pain (including pain from cancer and other terminal illnesses); to numb, for anxiety, for the treatment of diarrhea (prescription that is still valid in some cases) and to eliminate cough in all kinds of processes, from a simple flu to tuberculosis. For two centuries it was freely sold.

<p style="font-size: 17px;">Laudanum and opium were considered the most important medicine of all those that existed in the pharmacopoeia of that time. In Spain it was sold in pharmacies at the price of 30 cents per gram, in 1925.</p>
<img src="">
<p style="font-size: 17px;">During the nineteenth century, in Victorian England, its exclusively therapeutic use led to other more social ones. Artists and writers considered it a divine nectar due to its narcotic properties and began to use it as a method of inspiration. Among its most famous consumers were members of the so-called "Diodati Circle", Lord Byron's group of friends who met at the Villa Diodati in the summer of 1816.</p>

<p style="font-size: 17px;">Another of the illustrious characters who suffered from the effects of addiction, although not in his own flesh, was Rossetti. His painting Beata Beatrix emerged as a tribute to his wife, who died of an overdose of laudanum.</p>

<br>
<p style="font-size: 24px;">Symptoms</p>
<p style="font-size: 17px;">Opium commonly affects the part of the brain that regulates breathing; dyspnea is often the first symptom of an overdose. Other symptoms include pinpoint pupils, nausea, vomiting, constipation, weak pulse, low blood pressure and dehydration, cardiovascular depression, unresponsiveness, and death.</p>
